## Why can't I get gas costs?

The Octopus Energy API doesn't provide a way to correlate a user with its own meters, the products and local tariffs used by said meter. For electricity it's fairly easy to find out by scraping the dev page, but for gas it isn't. You won't find the correct product names as displayed in the API on the bill, or anywhere. Because of how obscure and difficult these details are to obtain, the feature was left out, as it would raise more questions than answers.
